# Image-picker
Image picker in React Native is a built-in library that allows users to choose an image from their device's photo library or camera roll. 
It provides an easy-to-use interface for selecting images, and handles the permissions required to access the device's camera and photo library.
With this library, developers can easily integrate image selection and capture functionality into their React Native apps. 
The library supports multiple image selection, camera capture, image compression, and more. 
It is widely used in React Native development for a variety of applications such as social media, e-commerce, and photography apps.
